# Operations runbook

Procedures for the risky/rare operations. The quick verification runbook lives in
CLAUDE.md; this is the deep version. Mirrors WarSlate's `docs/operations.md`.

## §1 — Database backup & recovery

The DB is a single sql.js file at `DB_PATH` (`/app/data/cardlistcompare.db` in Docker,
bind-mounted to `./data` on the host). `persist()` writes it atomically (temp → fsync →
rename) and keeps `cardlistcompare.db.bak` refreshed at boot and on graceful shutdown.

**Back up (safe while running):** the atomic rename means the live file is never torn, so
`cp ./data/cardlistcompare.db backup-$(date +%F).db` is safe on the supported local
filesystem. Admin Dashboard also offers a database download. Verify important copies with
`sqlite3 backup-YYYY-MM-DD.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"`. For a quiet restore point,
`docker compose stop` first. Keep independent dated copies; `.bak` is overwritten on normal
starts and stops and is not a versioned backup history.

**Recover:** `loadDatabase()` (`server/db.js`) already tries `DB_PATH`, then `.bak`, then
`.tmp` on boot, and **refuses to start** rather than overwrite a corrupt file with an empty
one. To restore manually: stop the container, replace `cardlistcompare.db` with a good copy
(or the `.bak`), start it. If boot logs "could not be loaded … refusing to start," the live
file is corrupt and no usable backup was found — restore from an external backup.

**Never** `getDb().run(...)` directly (bypasses persistence). Write through the `run()`
helper. See INVARIANTS.md #1.

The default data directory also contains `image-cache/` and `downloads/`. They are
regenerable image/ZIP artifacts; database backups do not include them. `IMAGE_CACHE_DIR`
and `DOWNLOADS_DIR` can override those paths. A database restore that references a missing
ZIP requires a new image download. Never run two backend processes against one `DB_PATH`:
each process owns an independent in-memory database and can overwrite the other's writes.

## §2 — External-API drift (the #1 cause of emergency releases)

Scryfall / Archidekt / Moxfield / MPC Autofill rename fields without notice; fixtures can't
catch it. When an import, price, or proxy feature breaks in the field:

1. **Reproduce against the LIVE API**, not a fixture — `curl` the actual endpoint and inspect
   the current JSON shape. Name the exact field that changed.
2. Providers and where we depend on them:
   - **Archidekt** — `GET /api/decks/{id}/` via nginx `/api/archidekt/`; parsed in
     `src/lib/fetcher.js`. Respects deck-level `includedInDeck` category flags.
   - **Moxfield** — `/v3/decks/all/{id}` via `/api/moxfield/`.
   - **DeckCheck / TappedOut / Deckstats / MTGGoldfish / TCGPlayer** — each has an nginx
     proxy block (`nginx.conf`) and a parser branch in `fetcher.js`. **A new source needs
     BOTH** a nginx `location` and a vite dev proxy (they drifted once — MTGGoldfish/TCGPlayer
     404'd in prod because only the vite proxy existed).
   - **Scryfall** — `/cards/collection` (batch, 75 max). Client: `src/lib/scryfall.js`;
     server: `server/lib/scryfall.js`. Results are keyed by the **requested** deck-text name
     (front-face-normalized, accent-insensitive), NOT Scryfall's echoed canonical name — a
     drift here silently zeroes DFC/accented prices.
   - **MPC Autofill** — `server/routes/mpcautofill.js` and `server/lib/mpcautofill.js`; the API has renamed fields twice
     (`cardIdentifiers`, DFC pair shape) → those were emergency patches v2.39.5–.7.
3. Fix the **mechanism**, not the symptom (don't special-case one card). Add a regression
   test that pins the new shape.

## §3 — New API endpoint checklist

When adding a `server/routes/*` endpoint:
1. Auth: wrap in `requireAuth` / `requireAdmin` unless deliberately public; verify resource
   ownership (no IDOR — check `user_id` matches).
2. Rate limit: add or reuse a limiter from `middleware/rateLimit.js` for anything expensive or
   auth-adjacent.
3. Validation: reject bad input with 400 (don't let it 500); cap body size.
4. If it imports a `src/lib/*` file, add that file to the Dockerfile `COPY src/lib/…` list —
   enforced by `invariants.test.js`, or prod crashes while dev works.
5. Write through the `run()`/`get()`/`all()` DB helpers only.

## §4 — Deploy & rollback (GHCR)

- CI requires passing client/server tests and zero ESLint errors, then builds the image.
  Pull requests build without publishing. Pushes to `main` publish
  `ghcr.io/cruv/card-list-compare:latest`, `:main`, `:sha-…`; requested `v*` tag pushes
  additionally publish semver tags. The published target is `linux/amd64`.
  The household deploy does **not** auto-pull — deploy deliberately.
- **Deploy:** ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set in the host `.env` (the container refuses to start
  without a strong one), then `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. Generate it
  with `openssl rand -hex 32`, store the output as the value, and retain it across updates.
  Rotating it logs everyone out. Compose reads the adjacent `.env`; it is not a shell script.
- **Smoke:** `curl http://localhost:8080/api/health`; load the UI; check the browser console
  for CSP violations if the release touched external resources.
- **Rollback:** pin the previous good image by its `:sha-…` tag in `docker-compose.yml` (or
  redeploy the prior commit). Take a database backup before deploying. Review migrations
  between versions before a rollback: migrations also repair stored data, so a blanket
  guarantee that any older code is compatible with a newer database is not valid. If a
  matching database restore is needed, stop the service first and account for newer writes.

## §5 — First-run / admin

First registered user (`id = 1`) becomes admin. In dev, register then restart the backend
once (admin promotion runs at startup). A fresh container installation needs the same
one-time restart (`docker compose restart`), followed by reloading or signing in again.
Admin panel: `#admin`.

Production has no default `JWT_SECRET`. Outside production, leaving it unset creates
`server/data/.jwt-dev-secret` (or beside a custom `DB_PATH`), so dev tokens normally survive
watch-mode restarts. If that directory is unwritable, the fallback is process-local.
Supplying a weak secret is an error even in development. The npm server scripts do not load
`.env`; export variables, or from the repository root run
`node --env-file=.env --watch server/index.js` after configuring a local `.env`.

## §6 — Image downloads and scheduled updates

The Scryfall image worker processes one queued job at a time. There are at most two pending
jobs per user and twenty overall. Interrupted processing jobs return to `queued` at startup.
Completed ZIPs expire after 24 hours; cleanup runs at startup and hourly. Scryfall images
are cached on disk, cleaned after 30 days by file modification time, and subject to the
`max_image_cache_mb` server setting. Check `[DownloadQueue]` logs and free disk space when
downloads stall. The MPC Autofill ZIP endpoint is a separate request-driven export.

The server scheduler checks for deck changes, due auto-refreshes, and price alerts. Its
global interval defaults to six hours and is configurable in Admin Settings. Per-deck
auto-refresh intervals are 6, 12, 24, 48, or 168 hours; due work runs on the next scheduler
cycle. Email alerts require configured SMTP, a verified address, and enabled per-deck
notifications. Discord alerts use the configured per-deck webhook. Price alerts measure
dollar change from a persisted baseline, not crossing an absolute deck-price target.

CLC's existing queue generates image ZIPs. Automatic page layout and home-printer job
submission are proposed in [PRINT_WORKFLOW.md](PRINT_WORKFLOW.md), not current operational
features. Drying, lamination and cutting remain outside CLC.
